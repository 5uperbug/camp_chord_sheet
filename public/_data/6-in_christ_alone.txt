[Intro]
{D    G    Bm    G }

[Verse 1]
          D        Bm7      A      
In Christ alone my hope is found,
D/F#     G         A            D
He is my light, my strength, my song;
     G     D            Bm7      A      
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
D/F#             G        A          D
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
D/F#            G          Bm7       A4
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
     D/F#      G             Bm7       A4
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
   G       D     Bm7    A
My Comforter, my All in All,
D/F#        G       A        D
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

[Verse 2]
          D        Bm7         A   
In Christ alone! – who took on flesh,
D/F#        G      A        D
Fullness of God in helpless babe.
     G        D        Bm7      A   
This gift of love and righteousness,
D/F#           G        A      D
Scorned by the ones He came to save:
D/F#          G       Bm7   A4
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
    D/F#     G       Bm7    A4
The wrath of God was satisfied 
    G     D      Bm7     A
For every sin on Him was laid;
D/F#        G        A        D
Here in the death of Christ I live.

[Verse 3]
             D          Bm7  A   
There in the ground His body lay,
D/F#         G        A        D
Light of the world by darkness slain:
     G        D        Bm7      A   
Then bursting forth in glorious day
D/F#        G        A    D
Up from the grave He rose again!
D/F#      G         Bm7   A4
And as He stands in victory
      D/F#      G        Bm7     A4
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,
    G    D       Bm7   A
For I am His and He is mine 
D/F#        G       A        D
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
 
[Bridge]
D                   G2 
I find my strength, I find my hope
Bm7            G2 
I find my help in Christ alone
D                  G2 
When fear assails, when darkness falls
Bm7             G2 
I find my peace in Christ alone
D               Em7 
I give my life, I give my all
D/F#           G2 
I sing my song to Christ alone 
D/A                Em7 
The King of kings, the Lord I love
D/F#             G2              D 
All heaven sings to Christ alone 

[Verse 4]
            D        Bm7     A   
No guilt in life, no fear in death,
D/F#        G        A         D
This is the power of Christ in me;
     G            D      Bm7    A   
From life’s first cry to final breath
D/F#  G           A    D
Jesus commands my destiny.
D/F#        G        Bm7       A4
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
    D/F# G        Bm7       A4
Can ever pluck me from His hand:
     G  D          Bm7      A
Till He returns or calls me home,
D/F#        G        A        D
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand.
