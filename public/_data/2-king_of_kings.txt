[Intro]
{D}
`Piano bop`

[Verse 1]
       F#/D             G
In the darkness we were waiting
        A             D
Without hope, without light
       F#/D             G
Till from heaven You came running
        A             D
There was mercy in Your eyes
       F#/D             G
To fulfill the law and prophets
        A             D
To a virgin came the word
       F#/D              G
From a throne of endless glory
     A             D
To a cradle in the dirt

`Piano bop`
[Chorus]
D                  G
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Bm                 Asus4    A
Praise the Spirit, three in one
D             G
God of glory, Majesty
Bm        G           A       D
Praise forever to the King of Kings

`Piano bop`
[Verse 2]
   F#/D               G
To reveal the kingdom coming
        A             D
And to reconcile the lost
   F#/D             G
To redeem the whole creation
        A               D
You did not despise the cross
    F#/D             G
For even in your suffering
        A            D
You saw to the other side
       F#/D              G
Knowing this was our salvation
      A                D
Jesus for our sake you died

[Verse 3]
`Only piano`
        Bm               G
And the morning that You rose
       A               D
All of heaven held its breath
          Bm                  G
Till that stone was moved for good
        A                  D
For the Lamb had conquered death
`Band builds up`
        Bm                   G
And the dead rose from their tombs
        A               D
And the angels stood in awe
        Bm                 G
For the souls of all who'd come
       A               D
To the Father are restored

`Full power!`
[Verse 4]
        F#/D               G
And the Church of Christ was born
         A              D
Then the Spirit lit the flame
         F#/D            G
Now this gospel truth of old
          A                 D
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
       F#/D             G
By His blood and in His name
       A             D
In His freedom I am free
        F#/D            G
For the love of Jesus Christ
         A          D
Who has resurrected me

`Piano bop`

Bm                 Asus4    A
Praise the Spirit, three in one
D             G
God of glory, Majesty
Bm        G           A       D
Praise forever to the King of Kings
F#/D      G           A       D
Praise forever to the King of Kings
