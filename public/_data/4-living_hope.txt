> KEY: B
> TEMPO:  BPM

[Verse 1]
              B              F#
How great the chasm that lay between us
             E        G#m         F#
How high the mountain I could not climb
        B                   F#
In desperation, I turned to heaven
               E    F#       B
And spoke Your name into the night
                 E                     G#m
Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
                 B             F#
Tore through the shadows of my soul
            B                   F#
The work is Ô¨Ånished, the end is written
      E          F#     B
Jesus Christ, my living hope

[Verse 2]
              B              F#
Who could imagine so great a mercy?  
                  E     G#m            F#
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
           B                      F#
The God of ages stepped down from glory
           E   F#          B
To wear my sin and bear my shame
              E             G#m
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
             B                 F#
The King of kings calls me His own
          B                 F#
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
      E          F#     B
Jesus Christ, my living hope

[Chorus]
     E   B             F#             G#m 
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
     E   B             F#             G#m
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
         E            B             
You have broken every chain
        F#                G#m
There's salvation in Your name
      E          F#     B
Jesus Christ, my living hope  (x2)

[Verse 3]
              B                       F#
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            E     G#m     F#
Your buried body began to breathe
           B                      F#
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
             E     F#              B
Declared the grave has no claim on me
              B                       F#
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            E     G#m     F#
Your buried body began to breathe
           B                    F#
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
             E         F#          G#m
Declared the grave has no claim on me
       E             F#      B
Jesus, Yours is the victory, whoa!

[Chorus]
     E   B             F#             G#m 
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
     E   B             F#             G#m
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
         E            B             
You have broken every chain
        F#                G#m
There's salvation in Your name
      E          F#     B
Jesus Christ, my living hope  (x2)

[Outro]
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Oh God, You are my living hope
