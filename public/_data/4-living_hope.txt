[Verse 1]
              B               F#
Hum mein woh doori, thi kitni gehri
      E         G#m  F#
Kitna bada tha, woh fasla
        B                   F#
Mayoos hokar, swarg ki oor dekha
        E    F#       B
Nirasha mein tera naam liya
         E              G#m
Andhkaar hataakar, teri mohabbat
        B             F#
Se mera dil thu ne Bhardhiya
          B            F#
Poora hua sab, likha gaya anth,
      E         F#        B
Yeshu Masih, tu hai Aasha Meri

[Verse 2]
              B              F#
Who could imagine so great a mercy?  
                  E     G#m            F#
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
           B                      F#
The God of ages stepped down from glory
           E   F#          B
To wear my sin and bear my shame
              E             G#m
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
             B                 F#
The King of kings calls me His own
          B                 F#
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
      E          F#     B
Jesus Christ, my living hope

[Chorus]
     E   B         F#         G#m 
Hallelujah, prabhu teri stuti ho
     E   B       F#            G#m
Hallelujah, tune haraya mruthyu ko
     E            B             
Tune todi har zanjeer
     F#        G#m
Tere naam mein rihai
      E         F#        B
Yeshu Masih, tu hai Aasha Meri

     E   B             F#             G#m 
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
     E   B             F#             G#m
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
         E            B             
You have broken every chain
        F#                G#m
There's salvation in Your name
      E          F#     B
Jesus Christ, my living hope  

[Verse 3]
     B                     F#
Aayi woh subah, wada poora hua
            E          G#m      F#
Bejaan shareer ne, fir saansein lin
           B           F#
Khamoshi mein se, tune pukara,
     E    F#       B
Kabr teri jeet hai kahan

[Verse 4]
              B                       F#
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            E     G#m     F#
Your buried body began to breathe
           B                    F#
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
             E         F#          G#m
Declared the grave has no claim on me
       E             F#      B
Jesus, Yours is the victory, whoa!

[Chorus]
     E   B         F#         G#m 
Hallelujah, prabhu teri stuti ho
     E   B       F#            G#m
Hallelujah, tune haraya mruthyu ko
     E            B             
Tune todi har zanjeer
     F#        G#m
Tere naam mein rihai
      E         F#        B
Yeshu Masih, tu hai Aasha Meri

Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
`Pause`
         E            B             
You have broken every chain
`Cymbals crash 3 note thingy`
        F#        G       G#m
There's salvation in Your name
      C#m        F#     G#m  B/D#
Jesus Christ, my living hope  
      C#m        F#     G#m  B/D#
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Oh God, You are my living hope
