[Intro]
{E    A}

[Verse 1]
     E          G#m       A                 E
What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
   B           C#m         A                B
Omniscient all-knowing, He counts not their sum
       E      F#m          G#m       A
Thrown into a sea, without bottom or shore
    A             E         B        A
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

[Interlude]
{E    A}

[Verse 2]
     E          G#m            A          E
What patience would wait as we constantly roam
     B         C#m       A          B
What Father so tender is calling us home
   E        F#m          G#m             A
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
    A             E         B        A
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

[Chorus]
           A  E C#m   B        A  E  B
Praise the Lord,  His mercy is more
A             E         B         C#m    
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
    A             E         B        E
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

[Interlude]
{E    A}

[Solo]
{E F#m G#m A     G#m}
{A G#m}
{B}

[Verse 3]
     E         G#m         A           E
What riches of kindness He lavished on us
    B             C#m      A                B
His blood was the payment, His life was the cost
   E              F#m           G#m     A
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
    A             E         B        A
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

[Chorus]
           A  E C#m   B        A  E  B
Praise the Lord,  His mercy is more
A             E         B         C#m    
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
    A             E         B        E
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
`Drums only`
           A  E C#m   B        A  E  B
Praise the Lord,  His mercy is more
`Full band`
A             E         G#7      C#m    
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
    A             E         B        C#m
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
    A             B                  E
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

[Outro]
