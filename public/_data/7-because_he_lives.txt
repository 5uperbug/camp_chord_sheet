> KEY: G
> TEMPO:  BPM

[Verse 1]
G                                  C
God sent His son, they called Him, Jesus;
           G              D      
He came to love, heal and forgive;
             G               C
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
         G                 D               C
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!


[Chorus]
G                            C
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           G                  D
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
          G       G/B       C     Am
Because I know He holds the future,
            G
And life is worth the living, 
D               C
Just because He lives!

 

[Verse 2]
             G                      C
And then one day, I'll cross the river,
                  B/G              D
I'll fight life's final war with pain;
             G                  C     Am
And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
             G                 D               C
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!


[Chorus]
G                            C
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           G                  D
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
          G  Am  G/B        C     Am
Because I know He holds the future,
            G
And life is worth the living, 
D               G
Just because He lives!
